We present Task Bench, a \emph{parameterized} benchmark designed to
explore the performance envelopes of parallel and distributed
programming systems under a variety of application scenarios. Task
Bench seeks to provide the ease of implementation and portability of
microbenchmarks, which makes comparisons between many systems
possible, with the ability to model a wide range of application
scenarios, giving it coverage approximating large benchmarks.

We conduct a comprehensive study with implementations of Task Bench in
13 programming systems on up to 256 Haswell nodes of the Cori
supercomputer. We introduce and use a novel metric, \emph{minimum effective task
  granularity} to study the baseline runtime overhead of each system
and the impact of different dependence patterns. We also
study each system's scalability, and the ability to hide communication and
mitigate load imbalance.
