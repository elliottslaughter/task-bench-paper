We introduce \emph{minimum effective task granularity} (METG), a new
metric for quantifying the fundamental performance behavior of
parallel and distributed runtime systems. METG is either directly
related to, or correlates with a variety of measures of direct
interest to application developers: namely the smallest problem size
that can be efficiently weak scaled, or the limit of strong
scalability. METG can be used to study the baseline overhead, scaling
behavior, and communication hiding ability of runtime systems, among
other properties.

We present Task Bench, a novel \emph{parameterized} benchmark for
exploring the behavior of parallel and distributed runtime
systems. Task Bench executes a configurable \emph{task graph} with
tasks for each point in an iteration space and dependencies determined
by a \emph{dependence relation}. We use Task Bench to conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of 13 runtime systems, and show that the
baseline overhead of these systems varies by up to 5 orders of
magnitude.
