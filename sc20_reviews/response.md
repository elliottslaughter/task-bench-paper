Responding to reviewer questions:

## Reviewer 1

  * Task graphs can be arbitrary, including irregular graphs. We added an example to Figure 1.

  * METG has already proven useful for exposing behaviors at the limits of system performance. We updated Section VI to clarify.

  * **FIXME: Please justify the use of small task granularity values (lower or equal than 1ms).**
