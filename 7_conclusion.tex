\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented Task Bench, a parameterized benchmark powerful enough to
enable the exploration of a broad space of application scenarios, but
also simple enough to permit implementation in a wide array of systems
to a level of quality sufficient for comparative study. Our study of
13 programming systems is novel in its breadth, as well as the depth
of insight it delivers about different systems. We discover, among
other things, that the baseline overhead of systems varies by up to 5
orders of magnitude.

Helping us in this endeavor is a new metric, minimum effective task
granularity (METG), which helps to sidestep a number of potential
issues in the evaluation of task scheduling performance, and helps to
separate such factors from changes in communication topology and
latency at increasing scales of the machine.
